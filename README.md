# Word-counter
HTML: Create a textarea element for users to input text, and a display area to show the word count.

CSS: Style the textarea and display area for better presentation and readability.

JavaScript: Write a script to count the number of words in the textarea input, update the display area with the word count, and handle any necessary formatting or validation.

Combined, these elements create a user-friendly word counter that dynamically updates as the user types or edits text in the textarea.
